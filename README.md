SyncedStore is an easy-to-use library for building collaborative applications that sync automatically. It's built on top of [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs), a proven, high performance CRDT implementation.

> **Nota bene**: this fork has been created in order to keep the original project (which seems to be inactive) up-to-date with Yjs. However, this basically covers the `core` sub-package only, not any of the others.

## TL;DR

Create apps like this:

_[Play with this example](https://syncedstore.org/docs/react)_

Using an API as simple as this:

```typescript
// add a todo
store.todos.push({ completed: false, title: "Get groceries" });

// set todo to completed
store.todos[0].completed = true;
```

We have several examples [on the website](https://syncedstore.org/) ([React](https://syncedstore.org/docs/react), [Vue](https://syncedstore.org/docs/vue), [Svelte](https://syncedstore.org/docs/svelte)) as part of the documentation.

In this repository, there are also more complex examples based on TodoMVC ([examples/todo-react](https://github.com/YousefED/syncedstore/tree/main/examples/todo-react), [examples/todo-vue](https://github.com/YousefED/syncedstore/tree/main/examples/todo-vue), [examples/todo-svelte](https://github.com/YousefED/syncedstore/tree/main/examples/todo-svelte)).

# Motivation

SyncedStore makes it easy to develop applications that:

- üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Are collaborative**: create multi-user and multi-device experiences without the need to handle complex conflict resolution management yourself.
- üöÄ **Are fast**: operations are handled locally, and data synchronization with other users and devices happens quietly in the background. 0 Latency!
- üîó **Work offline**: cloud apps typically don‚Äôt work while offline. Supporting both data sync and offline used to be difficult, SyncedStore aims to simplify this.

Perhaps most importantly, it makes it easy to build **decentralized applications**. This has a lot of security & privacy benefits compared to always relying on central (expensive) servers to keep track of all our data.

In short, with some technological magic of so-called [CRDTs](https://crdt.tech/) (_Conflict-free Replicated Data Types_), we can build _cross-device_ apps that are _more collaborative_, _faster_, _work offline_ AND put the user _back in control of their data_.
